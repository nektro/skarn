## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Configuration
This guide assumes you want to configure Skarn to a Discord server and auto-add members that have a specific role.

- Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
- Create an application and save down the Client ID and Client Secret.
- Add a bot to the application and save down the Bot Token.
- Add the bot to the server you wish to auth this instance throuh.
- Create a `~/.config/skarn/config.json`.

```json
{
	"port": 8000,
	"id": "{CLIENT_ID}",
	"secret": "{CLIENT_SECRET}",
	"bot_token": "{BOT_TOKEN}",
	"server": "{SERVER_ID}",
	"members": ["{ROLE_SNOWFLAKE"],
	"admins": ["{ROLE_SNOWFLAKE"],
	"themes": ["{THEME_ID}"],
	"announce_webhook_url": "{}"
}
```
- It should be in the above format.
    - `"members"` is an array of role snowflakes that will be added as a member. Member can create and fill requests.
    - `"admins"` is an array of role snowflakes that will be added as an admin. Admins can adjust the amount of points each request is worth.
- Lastly run the binary as follows obtained from either the *Deployment* or *Development* sections.

```bash
$ ./skarn
```

### Themes
Skarn supports custom themes through use of the `"themes"` property in your `config.json` to identify a folder or list of folders to overwrite any of the handlebars template files. The location to place themes is at `~/.config/skarn/themes/{THEME_ID}/`

### Announcements
Using the `"announce_webhook_url"` property you can create an announcements channel that will display status updates to requests. See https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks for more info on how to setup Discord Webhooks and get the URL.

### Deployment
By signing in with GitHub, you can download pre-built binaries from the *Artifacts* tab of https://circleci.com/gh/nektro/skarn.

### Development
- The Go Language 1.12+ (https://golang.org/dl/)
- GCC on your PATH (for the https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 installation)

```bash
$ go get -u -v github.com/nektro/skarn
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nektro/skarn/
$ ./scripts/build/all.sh
```
